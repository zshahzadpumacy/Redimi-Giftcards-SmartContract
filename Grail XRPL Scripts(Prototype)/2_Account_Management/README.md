The files in this section run a UI application based on code samples available on [XRP DEVELOPMENT REPO](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/tree/master/content/_code-samples/build-a-wallet).

**MODIFICATION:**

Token functionality has been added to the application to allow users to transfer token within the app. However, to make this possible, the receiver must set a trust line to the cold wallet manually since it requires the receiver's wallet.
